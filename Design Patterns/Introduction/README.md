## Before we practice Desgin Patterns

### Knowledge

We should know,

1. [Gang of Four](), the four authors of the book, "[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]()"\

2. Six principles of design patterns

   | <center>Principle</center> |  <center>aka</center>  |
   |:-------------------------------------------------|:----|
   | Single responsibility principle                  | SRP |
   | Liskov's Substitution Principle                  | LSP |
   | Dependency inversion  principle                  | DIP |
   | Interface Segregation Principle                  | ISP |
   | Dmitry's Law <br>(The least knowledge principle) | LoD |
   | The open closed principle                        | OCP |

3. Pattern types

   * Creational design patterns

     | Abstract Factory | Builder | Factory Method | Prototype | Singleton |
      
   * Structural design patterns

     | Adapter | Bridge | Composite | Decorator | Facade | Flyweight | Proxy |

   * Behavioral design patterns

     | Chain of responsibility | Command | Interpreter | Iterator | Mediator | Memento | Observer | State | Strategy | Template | Visitor |
