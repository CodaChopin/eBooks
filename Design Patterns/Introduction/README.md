## Before we practice Desgin Patterns

### Knowledge

We should know,

1. [Gang of Four](http://wiki.c2.com/?GangOfFour), the four authors of the book, "[Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)"

2. Six principles of design patterns

   | <center>Principle</center> |  <center>aka</center>  |
   |:---------------------------------------------------|:----|
   | Single responsibility principle                    | [SRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) |
   | Liskov Substitution Principle                      | [LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle) |
   | Dependency inversion principle                     | [DIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) |
   | Interface Segregation Principle                    | [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle) |
   | The Law of Demeter (The least knowledge principle) | [LoD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter) |
   | The open closed principle                          | [OCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle) |

3. Pattern types

   * Creational design patterns

     | Abstract Factory | Builder | Factory Method | Prototype | Singleton |
      
   * Structural design patterns

     | Adapter | Bridge | Composite | Decorator | Facade | Flyweight | Proxy |

   * Behavioral design patterns

     | Chain of responsibility | Command | Interpreter | Iterator | Mediator | Memento | Observer | State | Strategy | Template | Visitor |
